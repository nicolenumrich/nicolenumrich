### Hi there 👋 Nicole here.

❓ **Who am I?** Well, I've got the best job in the world where I get to talk about open source, how it powers the world, and sometimes they let me have access to our social accounts to post [fun GitHub Actions](https://twitter.com/github/status/1449110339291914241) or author blog posts that let me nerd out about the [evolution of open source and space exploration](https://github.blog/2022-01-18-how-open-source-is-supporting-nasas-new-eyes-in-space/) 🌍 🌎 🌏 Yes, yes I technically work in "marketing", but I'm trying to make it the fun, not boring marketing you might be thinking of...

But, one of my main focuses right now is about all things **GitHub Actions**: how they work, why devs should use them, how they are growing in capabilities, and more. Check out some of the latest GitHub Actions blogs ⬇️ _(note, I can't take credit for really much of this content, but good content is good content and my fellow Hubbers know what they're talking about)_:
